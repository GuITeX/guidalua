abstract = {Lua is spreading more and more throughout different areas of
software, from embedded systems and mobile devices to the Web and the Internet
of Things. Besides, it has a major role in the game industry, where knowledge of
Lua has become an indisputable asset. Lua is the language of choice for anyone
who needs a scripting language that is simple, efficient, extensible, portable,
and free. Programming in Lua is the official book about the language, providing
a solid base to any programmer who wants to use Lua. Authored by Roberto
Ierusalimschy, the chief architect of the language, it covers all aspects of Lua
5---from the basics to its API with C. The book is the main source of
programming patterns for Lua, with numerous code examples that help the reader
to make the most of Lua's flexibility and powerful mechanisms. Programming in
Lua is targeted at people with some programming background, but does not assume
any prior knowledge about Lua or other scripting languages. This Fourth Edition
updates the book to Lua 5.3 and marks a complete reorganization of the text.
Building on his many years of experience teaching Lua, Roberto has restructured
the book to present the material in a growing order of complexity, allowing the
reader to better absorb the character of the language.}
